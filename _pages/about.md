Hi, I am Aakash Ram Chandran, a `Machine Learning Engineer` based in Hamburg. I specialize in `computer vision` and `machine learning`, with hands-on experience training and deploying `deep learning models` for tasks such as `object detection` and `instance segmentation`.

I have optimized models for embedded systemsâ€”including deployments on `NVIDIA Jetson Orin`and tackle challenges in sensor fusion and edge computing using parallel programming tools like `CUDA`, `OpenMP`, and `MPI`.

## More About My Work Interests

My work in `reinforcement learning` has addressed real-world problems, such as jobshop scheduling and robotic pick-and-place tasks, and I maintain a strong interest in related fields like `imitation learning`, `interactive imitation learning`, and `inverse reinforcement learning`.

Additionally, I work with `ROS2` and `NVIDIA Isaac Sim` to create `digital twins` for robots, enabling simulation-based path planning and workflow efficiency analysis. I leverage Isaac Sim to generate `high-quality synthetic datasets` with annotations using `path tracing` for rendering the images, significantly reducing the need for extensive real-world images to train object detection and instance segmentation models through `transfer learning`. While these techniques might initially seem research-oriented, I have consistently implemented them in production settings to deliver practical, efficient solutions.

I am passionate about continuous learning and developing innovative solutions at the intersection of technology and practical applications. Please take a moment to explore my journey and projects.
