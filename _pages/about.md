Hi, I’m Aakash Ram Chandran, a Machine Learning Engineer based in Hamburg. I specialize in computer vision and machine learning, with hands-on experience in designing and deploying deep learning models that work with object detcetion, instance segmentation and much more.

I’ve optimized models for embedded systems such as NVIDIA Jetson Orin. I enjoy tackling challenges in sensor fusion and edge computing using parallel programming tools like CUDA, OpenMP and MPI.

I’m passionate about learning new skills and developing innovative solutions. I love working at the intersection of technology and real-world applications, and I’m excited to share my journey and projects with you.
